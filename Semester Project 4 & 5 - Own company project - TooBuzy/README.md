# TooBuzyB2C - Prototype
4. Semester project on UCN & Own company.

## Introduction
This project is based on the 3. Semester project.

The primary goal for this semester was to start own company and learn Android and iOS development
The technologies that I learned about and touched was (React, React-Native, Cordova, Xamarin, Ionic & Angular).
Based on the idea that the app should be accessible for everyone at anytime, made a clear way for Ionic with Angular, since it's supports PWA's. 

A LOT of other company related stuff was made at the same time as this prototype, so It's not much.

The app/system is made in Ionic & Angular as a prototype.

# TooBuzyB2C - Final but unfinished
5. Semester project on UCN & Own company.

## Introduction
This project is based on the 3 & 4. Semester project.

The primary goal here was to get some customers to test the prototype and start developing the real deal. 
Since we got 2/10 restaurants willing to test the app, we decide to start a production, since they liked the prototype and made a deal to be the first customers.
Based on all this, alot more company related suff was made.
The company got it's first two mentors: Andreas Dirksen & Pernille Nørhr.

Andres Dirksens: **<a href="https://signupacademy.com/en/home/" target="_blank">Check who he is?</a>**

And that's the end of the company's product for restaurants.
