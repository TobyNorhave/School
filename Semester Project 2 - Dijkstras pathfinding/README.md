# Dijkstra's pathfinding
1. Semester project on UCN.
 
## Introduction
This primary goal for this project was to implement Dijkstra's algorithm, in a transactionsystem for a fictitious fastfood chain.
The graph is implementet as a map over the local neighbourhood with roads and adresses.
The system also supports Async methods to avoid deadlocks when calculating routes.

This system is possible to send and optimize the route calculations, based on food priority. - In this case: What food is "best" to deliver first. 

This project is made in Java.
